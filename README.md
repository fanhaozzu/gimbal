# Gimbal

Maintainers: [Heptio](https://github.com/heptio)

## Overview

Heptio Gimbal is a layer-7 load balancing platform built on Kubernetes, the [Envoy proxy](https://www.envoyproxy.io/), and Heptio's Kubernetes Ingress controller, [Contour](https://heptio.github.io/contour/). It provides a scalable, multi-team, and API-driven ingress tier capable of routing Internet traffic to multiple upstream Kubernetes clusters and to traditional infrastructure technologies such as OpenStack.

Gimbal was developed out of a joint effort between Heptio and Yahoo Japan Corporation's subsidiary, Actapio, to modernize Yahoo Japanâ€™s infrastructure with Kubernetes,  without affecting legacy investments in OpenStack.

Early releases of Gimbal can discover services that run on Kubernetes and OpenStack clusters, but support for additional platforms is expected in future releases.

### Common Use Cases

* Organizations with multiple Kubernetes clusters that need a way to manage ingress traffic across clusters
* Organizations with Kubernetes and OpenStack infrastructure that need a consistent load balancing tier
* Organizations that want to enable their development teams to safely self-manage their routing configuration
* Organizations with bare metal or on-premises infrastructure that want cloud-like load balancing capabilities

## Supported versions

Gimbal runs on Kubernetes version 1.9 or later, but is tested to provide service discovery for clusters running Kubernetes 1.7 or later, or OpenStack Mitaka.

## Get started

Deployment of Gimbal is outlined in the [deployment section](deployment/README.md), which includes quick start applications.

## Documentation

Documentation for all the Gimbal components can be found in the [docs directory](docs/README.md).


## Known Limitations

* Upstream Kubernetes Pods and OpenStack VMs must be routable from the Gimbal load balancing cluster.
  * Support is not available for Kubernetes clusters with overlay networks.
  * We are looking for community feedback on design requirements for a solution. A possible option is one GRE tunnel per upstream cluster. [Feedback welcome here](https://github.com/heptio/gimbal/issues/39)!
* The Kubernetes Ingress API is limited and insecure.
  * Provides only one backend per route.
  * Anyone can modify route rules for a domain.
  * More complex load balancing features like weighting and strategy are not supported.
  * Gimbal & Contour will provide a solution with a [new IngressRoute CRD](https://github.com/heptio/contour/blob/master/design/ingressroute-design.md).

## Troubleshooting
